*Agile Scrum Methodology*

1. Agile scrum methodology is a project management system that relies on incremental development. 
2. Each iteration consists of two- to four-week sprints, where each sprint's goal is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product. 
3. More features are built into the product in subsequent sprints and are adjusted based on stakeholder and customer feedback between sprints.
4. Here are some of the collective benefits of agile scrum methodology:
        Flexibility and adaptability
        Creativity and innovation
        Lower costs
        Quality improvement
        Organizational synergy
        Employee satisfaction
        Customer satisfaction
